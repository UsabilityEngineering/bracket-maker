# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

### Bracket Maker: Rodrigo Lopez, William Lyons, Jose Sanchez

+ Methods:
  + Pilot Test:
    + Pilot test was the first research method the UX team used to reveal insights about the user experience by that of the team. The pilot test was a practice run of the user test, but executed by the UX team to help spot any last revisions for the protocol and prototype before performing the actual user test. To run the pilot test the UX team split into the different roles of moderator, note taker, and participant.
    
  + User Test:
    + User test was the second research method the UX team used to reveal insights about the user experience from a selected user test group. User testing is the process of collecting information about usability and overall user experience from actual users. The UX team had one moderator and one note taker for every participant from the user test group. The participant was given a select list of tasks to complete using the provided prototype with a time limit of about twenty minutes. During that testing portion, the participant was observed by the moderator and note taker for data collection.
    
+ Findings
  + Pilot Test:
    + From the pilot test conducted, we were able to see first hand what the participants from our future user testing would see and how they might perceive each task. We discovered some flaws within our prototype when we were trying to complete some of the tasks, which we were able to fix. We also thought up some new ideas that we could add to the prototype and the task list that would further benefit the usability experience of our project.
