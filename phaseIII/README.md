### Bracket Maker: Rodrigo Lopez, William Lyons, Jose Sanchez

+ Methods:
  + Pilot Test:
    + Pilot test was the first research method the UX team used to reveal insights about the user experience by that of the team. The pilot test was a practice run of the user test, but executed by the UX team to help spot any last revisions for the protocol and prototype before performing the actual user test. To run the pilot test the UX team split into the different roles of moderator, note taker, and participant.
    
  + User Test:
    + User test was the second research method the UX team used to reveal insights about the user experience from a selected user test group. User testing is the p ocess of collecting information about usability and overall user experience from actual users. The UX team had one moderator and one note taker for every participant from the user test group. The participant was given a select list of tasks to complete using the provided prototype with a time limit of about twenty minutes. During that testing portion, the participant was observed by the moderator and note taker for data collection.
