# Scenarios

1) **Joey DeGrandis's Scenario**

Joey is hosting a family game night and needs to create a bracket. As a user, Joey wants to find a simple and easy to use bracket maker. Although he has such a great memory and could probably remember the bracket he wants one that is visually attractive and easy to understand so that he can display it to his family as they play through their game night.


2) **Josh's Scenario**

Josh enjoys playing video games in his free time such as first-person shooters and fighting games. Game nights at work are fun but are often the main topic at work the next day if things get heated. As an Organizer, he wishes there was some way to keep track of a game between a group of people in an easy and very customizable way. Also potentially keeping stats of their win streak against another player.


3) **Edward Smith's Scenario**

There is this local gaming tournament that Edward is going to attend as a spectator. Edward purchased the tickets to attend the gaming tournament 2 months ago and today is the big day. Edward is really excited to go because he has been watching the people playing at the tournament since 4 years ago and today was the day that he was going to be able to see them in person. Due to this he has really high expectations. When arriving at the tournament Edward sits down and immediately sees that there is a screen showing a bracket of the teams playing. Edward is confused because the bracket is plain and dull just displaying the names. Edward is used to the bracket he sees online that is colorful, interactive, and it also shows the teams history like how many games they have played, their record history, the names and age of every single player, and also a interactive link where you can see the social networks of each player like Youtube, Twitch, Instagram, Twitter, etc.
