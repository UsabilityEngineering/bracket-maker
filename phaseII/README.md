# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes
### Bracket Maker: Rodrigo Lopez, William Lyons, Jose Sanchez
+ Methods:
  + Wireframing:
      + The first method we used this phase was creating a wireframe to gain a better visualization of our project and what we wanted to accomplish. Wireframing allows us to see how we want our project to look and function before actually starting any code. 
  + Cognative Walk-Through:
      + The Second method we used this phase was allowing testers to run cognative walk throughs by thinking like our personas and scenarios method while they go through our wireframe. This allows us to see if we were able to get all of the material we would need to satisfy the user. 

+ Findings
  + Cog. Walk-through: 
      + Two users were able to successfully complete one different scenario each. 
      + One user suggested a feature to have a "Popular Brackets" and "My brackets" feature for the home page.
  + Wireframing:
    + Going off the results from the cognitive walk-through, we conclude that the wireframes we created did a good job at capturing our core-functionality of the website and matching the user's expectations of how the website would work. 
    + There were no suggestions of what can be improved for the website, but, there was a suggestion on adding a feature for the home page.
    
+ Conclusions
  +  Adding the "Popular Brackets" and "My Brackets" feature to the home page would also mean we should allow users to search for any public bracket. We discussed the new finding to the software team and agreed on adding the feature on our list-of-features for the final product. For our Future Work, we will need to update our wireframes to reflect how the new feature plays a part in the website and the expected interaction on the website.
  
+ Caveats
  + One caveat of wireframing is that your wireframes are as good as your Scenarios. As a team, we have discussed the idea of adding a search feature for the bracket maker, but, the Scenarios we created didn't properly reflect this as a part of the interaction. The idea wasn't forgotten when creating the Scenarios, it just was not immediately obvious, until we started creating the wireframes, that we could have re-wrote a Scenario to properly reflect how the search feature plays a part in a target user's needs.
