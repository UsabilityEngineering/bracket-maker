# Bracket-Maker

**Problem**: Making a bracket for a tournament and communicating the timing and matchups to participants is challenging.

**Idea**: Some single page web app or other application that makes it easy to manage any kind of home spun or official tournament. You enter the participants and their contact info, the tournament setup (single / double elim. etc) and then the bracket is automatically built. Scheduling and notifications would be nice features.
