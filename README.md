# Bracket-Maker

**Problem**: Making a bracket for a tournament and communicating the timing and matchups to participants is challenging.

**Idea**: Some single page web app or other application that makes it easy to manage any kind of home spun or official tournament. You enter the participants and their contact info, the tournament setup (single / double elim. etc) and then the bracket is automatically built. Scheduling and notifications would be nice features.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Researched competitors using heuristic analysis
  + The heuristic analysis will help with improving where competitors did bad and recognizing what competitors did right
* Collaborated and came up with personas and scenarios for website

* Designed wireframes and prototypes of initial website design
  + Wireframes and prototypes help with the visualization and building of website given heuristic and personas/scenarios
