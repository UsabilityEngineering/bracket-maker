+ Methods
  + One of the first methods we used was heuristic. The reason we decided to use the heuristic method was because it helped us evaluate the users interests as well as the things that satisfies its needs.

  + The persona method was crucial to this project because it helped us design the user profile of our target audience. With this method we got an idea of how our user would want to use our website.

  + We incorporated the Sketches method to give us an abstract overview of our websites design and flow.
